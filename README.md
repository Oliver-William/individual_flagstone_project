## Purpose
A website for a business offering a consultancy service on diversity and inclusion policies and their implementation in workplace and educational settings.

To support the project objectives, the website will provide definitions of diversity and includsion, provide tips on how to promote and diversity and inclusion policy, as well as relevant external links.

### User Stories (excerpts copied directly from Code Institute's LMS resources:

"External User’s Goal: The user wants to gain a basic understanding of diversity and inclusion in the workplace or educational environment. They seek straightforward information and tips presented in a clear, organised format."

"Site Owner’s Goal: The site owner aims to create a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate webpage that introduces diversity and inclusion concepts and offers basic guidance on how to implement these practices. The focus is on clear communication through effective use of HTML and CSS, utilising Bootstrap for layout and design."

## Design Decisions
### Wireframes
Given the limited scope of the project, I opted not to use wireframes for design planning purposes.  In hindsight, whilst I do not think this adversely impacted the project, it would have been useful practice for future site development; I feel the use of wireframes would be essential for more complex websites.
### Colours
I wanted to choose a colour scheme that would be professional, clear and relatively vibrant, as I wanted the webpage to encourage the user to trust it as a source of information, but also to be engaged by it.
I decided that a light blue with a white background, broken up with carefully selected images, would offer a clean and captivating palette for the user.  Initally, I styled the website using #209CEE as a background colour with white text (#FFFFFF) overlaying it for the navigation bar and anchor links, but upon testing this for WCAG compliance, I found that this colour combination failed:
